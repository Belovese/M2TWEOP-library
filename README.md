## What is M2TWEOP?

The M2TW Engine Overhaul Project (M2TWEOP) is designed to expand the capabilities of the strategy game *Medieval 2: Total War*. EOP uses C++ and Assembly to modify the game's code in-memory and exposes this to the end user via a Lua API.

## Lua Examples

### Removing engine limits

```lua
function onPluginLoad()
    M2TWEOP.unlockGameConsoleCommands();
    M2TWEOP.setAncillariesLimit(16);
    M2TWEOP.setMaxBgSize(100);
    M2TWEOP.setReligionsLimit(50);
    M2TWEOP.setBuildingChainLimit(40);
    M2TWEOP.setGuildCooldown(3);
end
```

### Playing sounds, displaying GUIs and spawning units

```lua
-- onGeneralAssaultsGeneral is a custom EOP event
function onGeneralAssaultsGeneral(eventData)
    local attacker, defender = eventData.attacker, eventData.defender
    -- Check if the character is a Nazgul
    if (hasTrait(attacker, "NazgulRace")) then
        -- Play a sound
        playSound(nazgulScream)
        -- Display some text
        showWindow("The Nazgul have arrived.")
        -- Spawn a new unit
        spawnUnit("Gondor Infantry", "Anorien", "Minas Tirith", 3, 4, 1, 1)
    end
end
```

**How to build**
1. Clone the project
2. Run Developer Powershell for Visual Studio 2022 in Admin mode
3. Navigate to where you have cloned/extracted the project
4. Run a build script like

```powershell
# Default build script for full release
.\buildEOP.ps1 -modFolder "E:\Steam\steamapps\common\Medieval II Total War\mods\Tsardoms-2.2"

# Release build script without config or luaPluginScript.lua
.\buildEOPDev_release.ps1 -modFolder "E:\Steam\steamapps\common\Medieval II Total War\mods\Tsardoms-2.2"

# Debug build script without config or luaPluginScript.lua
.\buildEOPDev_debug.ps1 -modFolder "E:\Steam\steamapps\common\Medieval II Total War\mods\Tsardoms-2.2"
```
